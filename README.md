This is a StandAlone Oneliner Payload Creator written in python3. Anyone can use it by giving some important commands. For example:

python3 oneliner.py -ip 127.0.0.1 -p 4444 -t bash
Here the ip is mandatory but the port is optional as it's default value is 4444. '-t' argument is mandatory.

python3 oneliner.py -ip eth0 -t bash -I
Here the interface name will be accepted but you have to specify '-I' argument.

python3 oneliner.py -ip eth0 -t bash -I -e url
Here '-e' argument mentions an url encodiing.

python3 oneliner.py -ip eth0 -t bash -I -e base64 <or b_64 or b64 or base_64>
Here '-e' argument mentions an base64 encoding.

python3 oneliner.py -l
It lists the types of payloads and encoders availiable currently.

You will require some requirements for the script.
Just give executive permissions and execute the requirements script.
And it will download and fulfill all the requirements.

Hope it will help you.
